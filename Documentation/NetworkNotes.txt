Order for additional network functions according to Jos-Yule on the forumns 5 years ago (https://forum.unity.com/threads/onstartclient-called-before-scene-is-fully-loaded.427952/)
	Awake
	OnStartServer
	OnStartClient
	OnStartLocalPlayer
	OnStartAuthority (not sure if this is before or after local player actually, need to read the source)
	OnEnable (this might come right after Awake, before all the OnStartXXX calls, not sure)
	Start
	Update
	OnDisable
	OnNetworkDestroy (this might actually come before OnDisable, not 100% sure)
	OnDestroy



The Commandments of Mirror Networking

1. Thou shalt never use Awake or Start in NetworkBehaviours.
	Stuff for networking isn't initialized yet, so isLocalPlayer doesn't really work.
	I was managing to get by with Start for a while, but seems dangerous.
	Use instead OnStartLocalPlayer, OnStartClient, OnStartAuthority, or OnStartServer.
